# Capstone-Project--Loan-Default-Prediction

A classification model to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan and give recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.

**Objectives of the Capstone**
 
  ●  Experienced end-to-end problem-solving using a combination of tools and techniques in machine learning.
  
  ●  Practical implementation of various analytical techniques and choose the one that gives results most appropriate for business.
  
  ●  Understand the trade-offs that need to be made when solving a real-life problem.
  
  ●  Developed better presentation and report-writing skills.

  
  **Highlights:**
  
Built four predictive models: • Logistic Regression • XGBoost • Decision Trees • Random Forest Model. 

Models were evaluated based on precision, recall and f1-score. Optimal thresholds were set based on precision and recall curves. Tuned the model with GridSearchCV and different hyperparameters to get better validation. Used SHAP to understand the logic behind a black-box model’s outputs.
